**Overview**

Each vignette file is made up of 2 folders: Scripts, which themselves contain the micro game scripts, the twitch stream scripts during play, and then the macro post stream scripts. Storyboards: these will typically only contain one file that is constantly being polished and elaborated upon in order for us to get an overview of the vignette’s direction.

**File Naming Conventions**

	•	Micro Game Scripts: Micro Game Script_vignette#_version#
	•	Twitch Stream Scripts: Twitch Stream_vignette#_version#
	•	Post-Game Macro Scripts: Macro Game Script_vignette#_version#
	•	Storyboards: Story Board_vignette#_version#

An example would look like this:

Micro Game Script_V2_8 (this is the 8th version of the micro game script dialogue for vignette 2)

**Script File Types**

Scripts should be produced in text files that follow the Ren’Py conventions outlined by Jules. This is to make implementation into Ren’Py much easier <3

**Archived Content**

If you are archiving any content but want to keep it on the GitHub for reference, please create a separate folder within the specific asset folder titled “Obsolete” and move the archived file from the main folder to the Obsolete folder.
