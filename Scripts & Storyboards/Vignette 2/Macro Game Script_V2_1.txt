"You take off your headset and lean back into the chair, listening to the faint music as people sign off from the chat."
"You receive a notification on discord. It’s from the mod of your stream."
mod "Hey bud, great stream again, so glad you decided to keep going with the game!" 
mod "How're you doin? Seemed like you were getting real into it."

go to reluctantoutlaw3
