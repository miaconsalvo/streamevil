#Script for Macro-Game Vignette 2

#This script is a rought draft for what the macro-game section of vignette 2 might look like.
#The scene involves the immediate aftermath of the stream with some comments from viewers 
#and then a reflection with the Mod about how the Streamer feels about the decisions they've made and where the stream is heading.
#I tried to keep the script and choices simple.
#I also represented it using RenPy code to more easily show when choices would appear.
#This could will not actually run in RenPy since none of the variables are defined and it is incorrectly formatted.
#The goal was just to create a draft script that was readable while still indicating moments of choice for the player.

#Here is the start of the script:
#if choice == Renegade and viewership == high:
    "The stream ends and comments flood the chat." #would cut and show comments in-game instead of having this line.
    "Squeejieboy33" "Interesting...I'm going mainly ParaMoze but RenMoze almost seems to fit her character more."
    "Coriolis" "Aww I was hoping we'd side with the doc on this one. What's Mac going to think?!?"
    "SeggsyBard89" "Thanks for the stream! Might check this game out, see what different options look like. GLHF!"
    "Meeloheelo" " Right choice imo. Shit's rough but so's the world right"
    "just3catsinatrenchcoat" "Love the stream! Glad to see someone doing an \"evil\" run. Most people I see out here are just doing ParaMoze. Boring!"

#if choice == Renegade and viewership == low:
    "The stream ends and comments flood the chat." #would cut and show comments in-game instead of having this line.
    "Coriolis" "Aww I was hoping we'd side with the doc on this one. What's Mac going to think?!?"
    "Seggsyard89" "Thanks for the stream! Might check this game out, see what different options look like. GLHF!"
    "Squeejieboy33" "Interesting...I'm going mainly ParaMoze but RenMoze almost seems to fit her character more."

#if choice == Paragon and viewership == high
    "The stream ends and comments flood the chat." #would cut and show comments in-game instead of having this line.
    "Coriolis" "Yes! Glad to see Moze getting back on track! Gotta take care of Mac!"
    "Squeejieboy33" "I'm also running ParaMoze...but IDK. RenMoze might fit her character better??"
    "Seggsybard89" "Thanks for the stream! Might check this game out, see what different options look like. GLHF!"
    "Meeloheelo" "@Squeejieboy33 ya, ParaMoze seems a bit contrived sometimes. Like it's a universe of outlaws but there's always a convenient good option?"
    "karatkitcat" "Love the stream, such a good vibe!"

#if choice == Paragon and viewership == low
    "The stream ends and comments flood the chat." #would cut and show comments in-game instead of having this line.
    "Coriolis" "Yes! Glad to see Moze getting back on track! Gotta take care of Mac!"
    "Seggsybard89" "Thanks for the stream! Might check this game out, see what different options look like. GLHF!"
    "karatkitcat" "Love the stream, such a good vibe!"

    "I receive a discord notification from my mod." #Again, in-game, would actually show this instead of telling.

    "mod" "I hear you."
    "mod" "I mean, yeah, going that Renegade route seems good for the numbers. Like there's not a lot of people out there doing it, so it would set you apart."

        "Streamer" "I get it, but I think if I'm gonna go Ren Moze, it's more to see how the game looks with that Outlaw style, rather than for the audience.":
