#ENERGY IS LOW from the stream 

--End of the stream--

*The stream ends on the final renegade choice, Moze and the crew are riding in the train engine straing out of the blown out wall of the cart. The detached body of the train growing small in the distance, your excort taking final shots at you before the train explodes. MAC buries themselves in Moze's arms out of fear.#

"Wow..." 
"Don't really know how we're gonna top that, so this will be a great spot to end"
