**Overview**

This folder is for all assets and art documentation/information. There will be 3 folders within this folder in order to better categorize our assets: Backgrounds, Characters, and User Interface. Eventually, we will likely also have "Sound" as a folder here.

**Asset Naming Conventions**

Note that Ren’Py has specific file types that it can use as well as specific naming conventions for the art assets. Below is (my understanding) of it.

- all assets must be written in lowercase. 
- all assets are typically defined by 2 descriptors: TAG ITEM (always separated by a space). *example: background spaceship or bg spaceship*
- for characters please name them similarly: NAME EMOTION. *example: teresa angry*

**Asset File Types**

Note that Ren’Py accepts these image files:
- png
- jpeg
- webp

**Archived Content**

If you are archiving any content but what tokeep it on the GitHub for reference, please create a separate folder within the asset folder titled "obsolete" and move the archived file from the main folder to the obsolete folder.
