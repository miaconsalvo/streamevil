        #This frame displays the main page of Blueit Threads as a single image, like how we'll show specific threads
        #Downside to this is lack of flexibility if we want to change anything about the threads. We'll be displaying the whole image
        #in its entirety so there's less modularity. This is relevant for one of the upsides which is flexibility in what parts
        #of the image are buttons. By displaying this as a single image, we can cut out the "titles" from the top of the threads
        #and then render them as textbuttons in Ren'Py. Then, we can also put buttons to activate the "upvote" buttons.
        #There's another downside that results from this though which is just that we need to be fairly particular and specific about
        #what parts we're leaving out of the image, it also means we'll need to make sure to get Ren'Py to display the textbuttons
        #with the right font. So we also sacrifice a bit in terms of the look. The second upside though is just that it's easy to implement at first
        #The downside is that we would probably need to create specific placements for each successive screen after each vignette - cause where the
        #textbuttons and image buttons line up might change each time. So in order to get the benefit of the visual flexibility, it comes at the cost
        #of time.
