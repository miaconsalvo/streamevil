**Overview**

Everything has been organized into 4 folders: Art Documents, Blog Posts, Builds & Codes, and Scripts & Storyboards. Each has its own ReadMe so they are easy to navigate and understand. 

**Adding Files**

Adding a file requires you to name it up top as well as name the folder its going into. An easy way to do this is to copy the path from something already there and then to add your item. If you are adding text, perfect! If not, you sorta have to create a random textfile and then add your documents and then delete the random textfile. This is the way I've been doing it but if there's a better way I'm all ears! In some folders there's only something called a "placeholder" this is because github doesnt allow you to add empty folders, so as soon as something is added to the folder feel free to just delete the placeholder textfile!!
