**Overview**

This document is meant to be a reference for any and all information you might need as you draft your blog posts. Within it, it contains a guide to SEO, blog categories and title conventions, category colours, and links to documentation regarding the blog schedule/publishing. 

**Categories**

	•	PINK: Sketch to Screen (Art & Character Design)

	•	PURPLE: Under the Hood (Coding in Ren’Py)
	•	BURGUNDY: Choiceology (Research)

**Blog Guidelines**

	•	Every meeting we will decide on 1 or 2 posts we want drafted/posted by the next meeting. 
	•	Posts should be max 1500 words; consider this more of a suggestion than a stricture
	•	Try to upload your posts as word or pdf files to this folder so we can see the images being used (if any). 
	•	Blog titles/file names should be as follows: CATEGORY NAME: SUBTITLE
